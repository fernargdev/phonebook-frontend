# Deployment in Render

## Description:

With the objective of deploying the frontend of the phone book in [render](https://render.com/). Separate this application into a new repository. The new repository can be found here [phonebook-frontend](https://github.com/fernargdev/phonebook-frontend). The URL of the implementation can be found here: [phonebook-backend-render](https://phonebook-backend-gqub.onrender.com/). The frontend was not deployed separately but rather as static content of the backend, so it is the back that renders the front.
